		<h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p>This is a modular multiplication circle. It is constructed in the following way:</p>
		<p>First, you draw a circle. Then, you pick a number of points n and a multiplier m and place n points points evenly spaced on the perimeter of the circle. Now label them 1 to n. Then, for every point on the circle, multiply its number by your multiplier and draw a line from the original point to the one you just calculated. If the result is greater than the number of points, you simply loop around (44 becomes 4).</p>
		<p>This entire thing is inspired by a T-Shirt made by the Vsauce guys and shipped in the Curiosity Box. If you want to get a box you can sign up for it on <a href="https://www.curiositybox.com/">https://www.curiositybox.com/</a>. But keep in mind that you won't get the one with the T-Shirt with this motive.</p>
